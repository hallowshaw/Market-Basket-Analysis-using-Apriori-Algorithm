# Market Basket Analysis with Apriori Algorithm

## Overview

This Python project demonstrates the implementation of Market Basket Analysis using the Apriori Algorithm. Market Basket Analysis is a technique used in retail to discover associations between products purchased by customers. The Apriori Algorithm is a classic algorithm for association rule mining, and in this project, it is applied to analyze a market dataset.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Apyori

Install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib apyori
```


### Dataset

The dataset (market_data.csv) should be in the project directory. Ensure it has the necessary transaction data for market basket analysis.


## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/market-basket-analysis.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd market-basket-analysis
```


3. Run the script:

```bash
python market_basket_analysis.py
```
Adjust the file path in the script if your dataset is located elsewhere.


## Results

The script outputs association rules based on the parameters set for minimum support, minimum confidence, minimum lift, and minimum length. Results include rule details such as support, confidence, and lift for each association.

## Parameters

- **min_support**:  Minimum support threshold for itemsets.
- **min_confidence**: Minimum confidence threshold for association rules.
- **min_lift**: Minimum lift threshold for association rules.
- **min_length**: Minimum number of items in an association rule.


## Example

```python
association_rules = apriori(records, min_support=0.0045, min_confidence=0.2, min_lift=3, min_length=2)
association_results = list(association_rules)

# Print the first association rule
print("Rule: " + str(list(association_results[0][2][0][0])) + " -> " + str(list(association_results[0][2][0][1])))
print("Support: " + str(association_results[0][1]))
print("Confidence: " + str(association_results[0][2][0][2]))
print("Lift: " + str(association_results[0][2][0][3]))
```
Adjust the parameters based on your dataset and analysis requirements.
